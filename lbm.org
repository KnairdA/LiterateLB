#+BEGIN_ABSTRACT
This file describes a full Lattice Boltzmann code featuring both 2D and 3D lattices, a workable selection of boundary conditions, Smagorinsky
turbulence modelling, expression-level code optimization and even a full ray marcher for just-in-time volumetric visualization in addition
to a set of interesting examples. All of this runs on GPUs using CUDA near the maximum possible performance on that platform.

* Introduction
Approaches to modeling fluid dynamics can be coarsely grouped into three categories: Microscopic, Mesoscopic and Macroscopic models.
Microscopic models describe the behavior of the individual /particles/ of whose the macroscopic fluid movement is an emergent property.
On the other side of the spectrum, macroscopic models consider only the large scale properties of a fluid such as its velocity and density
fields. One could say that microscopic particle models are closest to what actually happens in nature and macroscopic models in the form
of the /Navier Stokes equations (NSE)/ represent an ideal vision of a fluid that only holds for /large enough/ space scales.
As is the case for most things, what we call a /fluid/ is by itself already an abstraction.

Mesoscopic models sit between these two extremes and consider neither individual particles nor purely macroscopic properties but rather
the probability of some amount of particles moving with some velocity into a certain direction at various points in time and space. The
mathematical field of /kinetic theory/ provides a foundation for linking all of these three models.

** Kinetic Theory
One can use kinetic theory to get from a microscropic or /molecular/ system governed by e.g. Newton's laws of motion to macroscopic
descriptions of certain properties of such a system. For example one can reach the diffusion equation for /billiard systems/ of particles
colliding with solid obstacles or to the Navier Stokes equations for systems of pairwise colliding particles.

In very rough terms one starts out by considering the microscopic system and taking its limit for infinitely many particles of
vanishingly small size. This yields a /kinetic equation/ that describes the behaviour of the particle distribution function
under some collision operator for any point in space and time. When we consider pairwise colliding particles the result
turns out to be the well known /Boltzmann transport equation/:

$$(\partial_t + v \cdot \nabla_x) f(t,x,v) = \Omega (f).$$

This PDE describes the behavior of the probability $f(t,x,v)$ that particles move into direction $v$ at location $x$ and time $t$ for
some collision operator $\Omega$. Discretizing this equation on a lattice for a finite set of discrete velocities is called the /Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM)/.

The practical usefulness of LBM hinges on the ability of reaching the desired /target equations/
such as NSE or the heat equation as a limit of the kinetic equation.

** Lattice Boltzmann Method
We discretize the Boltzmann equation in spatial, velocity and temporal space on a cartesian lattice using discrete velocities
$\xi_i$ that point to the neighbors of each cell.

$$(\partial_t + v \cdot \nabla_x)f = \Omega(f) \approx f_i(x + \xi_i, t + 1) - f_i(x,t) = \Omega_i(x,t)$$

A common collision operator $\Omega$ for Navier-Stokes approximation is given by Bhatnagar, Gross and Kroog (BGK).

$$\Omega(f) := -\frac{f - f^\text{eq}}{\tau}$$

This BGK operator /relaxes/ the local population $f$ towards some equilibrium distribution $f^\text{eq}$ with rate $\tau$. Inserting this operator
into the discrete Boltzmann equation yields the discrete LBM BGK equation.

$$f_i(x + \xi_i, t + 1) = f_i(x,t) - \frac{1}{\tau} (f_i(x,t) - f_i^\text{eq}(x,t))$$

This explicit form exposes the separation of the LBM algorithm into a local collision step followed by a streaming step.
The collision step relaxes the population of each cell towards its local equilibrium and the streaming step propagates the resulting
updated population values to the respective neighboring cells.

Macroscopic moments such as density and velocity can be calculated directly from the distribution functions.

$$\rho := \sum_{i=0}^{q-1} f_i(x,t) \text{ and } u := \frac{1}{\rho} \sum_{i=0}^{q-1} \xi_i f_i(x,t)$$

The equilibrium distribution $f_i^\text{eq}$ for these macroscopic properties is given by

$$f_i^\text{eq}(x,t) := \omega_i \rho \left( 1 + \frac{u \cdot \xi_i}{c_s^2} + \frac{(u \cdot \xi_i)^2}{2c_s^4} - \frac{u \cdot u}{2c_s^2} \right)$$

using lattice-dependent weights $\omega_i$ and speed of sound $c_s$. Note that this is just one possible discretization of the Boltzmann
equation -- nothing stops us from using different sets of velocities, relaxation times, collision operators and so on.
Changing these things is how different physics are modeled in LBM. e.g. what we will do in the section on
[[*Smagorinsky BGK Collision][Smagorinsky turbulence modelling]] is to locally change the relaxation time.

To summarize what we are going to do for the simplest bulk fluid case: First calculate the current density and velocity
moments of a cell, then compute the matching equilibrium distributions and finally perform the local BGK collision to
update the cell populations.
The last step before we start again is to propagate the post-collision values to the corresponding neighbor cells. 

Special care has to be taken for the boundary conditions at the lattice frontier and around any obstacle geometries.
Such boundary conditions are one of the major topics of LBM research with a very rich toolbox of specialized collision
steps for modeling e.g. inflow, outflow, solid or moving walls of various kinds.

As a starting point for further reading on LBM I can recommend the de facto standard text

** Literate Programming
The present website is the documentation /woven/ from the literate program file [[https://code.kummerlaender.eu/LiterateLB/tree/lbm.org][=lbm.org=]].
In the same fashion this program file may also be /tangled/ into compilable code.
Programs written using this paradigm are commonly referred to as /literate/ and promise
to decouple program exposition from the strict confines of machine-targeted languages.

LiterateLB utilizes the literate programming framework offered by [[https://emacs.org][Emacs's]] [[https://orgmode.org][Org Mode]].

The easiest way to tangle and compile the project is to use the [[https://nixos.org][Nix package manager]].
On CUDA-enabled NixOS hosts the following commands are all that is needed to tangle,
compile and run one of the simulation examples:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh :eval no
git clone https://code.kummerlaender.eu/LiterateLB
cd LiterateLB
nix build
./result/bin/nozzle
#+END_SRC

On other systems the dependencies
+ Emacs 28 (earlier possible for up-to-date orgmode)
+ CMake 3.10 or later
+ Nvidia CUDA 10.2 or later
+ SFML 2.5 or later and ImGui-SFML
+ Python with SymPy, NumPy, SciPy and Mako
will have to be provided manually. Note that the current tangle output is included so strictly
speaking compiling and testing the examples requires neither Emacs nor Python.

Note that I started developing this as a beginner in both Emacs and Org mode so some aspects of this document
may be more clunky than necessary. Most of the complexity stems from maintaining a Python session for the
generation of optimized GPU kernel functions using the SymPy CAS:
* Lattice
The cartesian grids used for the spatial discretization are commonly described as =DXQY= lattices where =X= is the number of spatial dimensions
and =Y= is the number of discrete velocities $\xi_i$. e.g. a  =D2Q9= lattice is two dimensional and stores nine population values per cell. Each population has
an associated weigth $\omega_i$ that in a sense controls its impact on the collision step. Additionally we also require the lattice speed of sound $c_s$ which is
the speed of information propagation within the lattice.

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session :results none
from fractions import Fraction

class Descriptor:
    def __init__(self, name, data):
        self.name = name
        self.c = [ Matrix(eval(row[0]))    for row in data ]
        self.w = [ Rational(f.numerator, f.denominator)
                   for f in [ Fraction(row[1]) for row in data ] ]
        
        self.d = self.c[0].shape[0]
        self.q = len(self.c)
        self.c_s = sqrt(Rational(1,3))
#+END_SRC

All of these constants have to be accessible for symbolic computations which is why we store them within a so called descriptor class.
For convenience we write out the directions and weights as plain tables that are then read into the Python structure.

* Collision Steps
While the streaming step of the LBM algorithm only propagates the populations between cells in an unform fashion,
the collision step determines the actual values those populations take. This means that the physical behaviour
modelled by a given LBM algorithm is determined primarily by the collision step.

In this section we are going to generate the code for bulk collisions. i.e. the collisions that model fluid and other transport
phenomena apart from domain boundaries. Those will be handled at a later point by special purpose collision steps called
/boundary conditions/.

** Code printing
Before we can get started on constructing expression trees and generating code from them we need to
setup some basics so SymPy actually generates something we can compile in our environment.

In order to get more fine grained control we need to overload an approproate SymPy C code printer class.
This allows us to e.g. easily print indexed expressions that access the population array in the correct way
or to explicitly type float constants according to a compile-time template type.

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session :results none
from sympy.printing.ccode import C11CodePrinter

class CodeBlockPrinter(C11CodePrinter):
    def __init__(self, custom_assignment, custom_functions):
        super(CodeBlockPrinter, self).__init__()
        self._default_settings['contract'] = False
        self.custom_assignment = custom_assignment
        for f in custom_functions:
            self._kf[f] = f
     
    def _print_Indexed(self, expr):
        assert len(expr.indices) == 1
        if expr.base.name[0] == 'f':
            return f"{expr.base.name}[{expr.indices[0]}]"
        else:
            return f"{expr.base.name}_{expr.indices[0]}"
    
    def _print_Float(self, flt):
        return "T{%s}" % str(flt.evalf())

    def _print_Pow(self, expr):
        if expr.exp == -1:
            return "T{1} / (%s)" % self.doprint(expr.base)
        else:
            return super()._print_Pow(expr)

    def _print_Assignment(self, expr):
        if self.custom_assignment and expr.lhs.is_Indexed and expr.lhs.base.name[0] == 'f':
            return f"{self.doprint(expr.lhs)} = {self.doprint(expr.rhs.evalf())};"
        else:
            return f"T {self.doprint(expr.lhs)} = {self.doprint(expr.rhs.evalf())};"
#+END_SRC

For convenience the instantiation of this class is hidden in a =printcode= function that we can use everywhere.

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session :results none
def printcode(expr, custom_assignment=True, custom_functions=[]):
    print(CodeBlockPrinter(custom_assignment, custom_functions).doprint(expr))
#+END_SRC

The additional assignment parameter allow us to control whether the targets of assignment expressions should be
instantiated as a new scalar variable in addition while the functions parameter allows us to make custom runtime
functions known to SymPy. If we don't do this for a function =f= that our assignment expression contains a reference
to, the printer will generate unwanted comments to reflect this.

*** Custom expression transformations
We do not want to use the =pow= function for squares in the generated code. This can be achieved by providing
a custom =ReplaceOptim= structure during the CSE optimization step that conditionally resolves =Pow= expressions.

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session :results none
from sympy.codegen.rewriting import ReplaceOptim
from sympy.simplify import cse_main

expand_pos_square = ReplaceOptim(
    lambda e: e.is_Pow and e.exp.is_integer and e.exp == 2,
    lambda p: UnevaluatedExpr(Mul(p.base, p.base, evaluate = False))
)

custom_opti = cse_main.basic_optimizations + [
    (expand_pos_square, expand_pos_square)
]
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session :results none
def cse(block, symbol_prefix = 'x'):
    return block.cse(symbols = numbered_symbols(prefix=symbol_prefix), optimizations = custom_opti, order = 'none')
#+END_SRC

** Moments
#+BEGIN_SRC python :session :results none
i, j = symbols('i, j')
d, q = symbols('d, q')
xi = IndexedBase('xi')
#+END_SRC

To start we define placeholders for the spatial and discrete velocity dimensions as well as the velocity set $\xi$ of
some lattice. As the moments are constructed using the lattice populations $f$ we also require placeholders
for those in addition to the moments $\rho$ and $u$ themselves.

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session :results none
f = IndexedBase('f')
rho = Symbol('rho')
u = IndexedBase('u', d)
u_i = Symbol('u_i')
#+END_SRC

We are now ready to formulate the density moment which is simply the sum of a cell's populations.

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session :results output replace :wrap latex
def rho_from_f(f, q):
    return Assignment(rho, Sum(f[j], (j, 0, q-1)))

printlatexpr(rho_from_f(f, q))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_latex
$$\begin{align*}
\rho &:= \sum_{j=0}^{q - 1} {f}_{j} \\
\end{align*}$$
#+end_latex

Next we build the velocity moment function. The i-th component of the velocty $u$ is the sum of all
relevant populations divided by the density. In this context /relevant/ populations are all values $f_j$ 
for which the i-th component of velocity $\xi_j$ is non-zero.

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session :results output replace :wrap latex
def u_i_from_f(f, q, xi):
    return Assignment(u_i, Sum(xi[j,i] * f[j], (j, 0, q-1)) / Sum(f[j], (j, 0, q-1)))

printlatexpr(u_i_from_f(f, q, xi))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_latex
$$\begin{align*}
u_{i} &:= \frac{\sum_{j=0}^{q - 1} {f}_{j} {\xi}_{j,i}}{\sum_{j=0}^{q - 1} {f}_{j}} \\
\end{align*}$$
#+end_latex

Both to illustrate what we are actually going to compute for a given lattice cell and as the
next step towards code generation we now want to /realize/ our abstract moment expressions
for a concrete lattice.

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session :results output :wrap latex
def realize_rho(D):
    return rho_from_f(f, D.q).doit()

D = descriptor[lattice]
printlatexpr(realize_rho(D))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_latex
$$\begin{align*}
\rho &:= {f}_{0} + {f}_{1} + {f}_{2} + {f}_{3} + {f}_{4} + {f}_{5} + {f}_{6} + {f}_{7} + {f}_{8} \\
\end{align*}$$
#+end_latex

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session :results none
def from_indices(elems, car, *cdr):
    return elems[car] if len(cdr) == 0 else from_indices(elems[car], *cdr)

def realize_indexed(expr, idx, values):
    return expr.replace(lambda expr: expr.is_Indexed and expr.base.name == idx.name,
                        lambda elem: from_indices(values, *elem.indices))
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session :results output :wrap latex
def realize_u_i(D, j):
    return realize_indexed(u_i_from_f(f, D.q, xi).doit().subs([(u_i, u[j]), (i, j)]), xi, D.c)

D = descriptor[lattice]
printlatexpr(realize_u_i(D, 0))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_latex
$$\begin{align*}
{u}_{0} &:= \frac{- {f}_{0} - {f}_{1} - {f}_{2} + {f}_{6} + {f}_{7} + {f}_{8}}{{f}_{0} + {f}_{1} + {f}_{2} + {f}_{3} + {f}_{4} + {f}_{5} + {f}_{6} + {f}_{7} + {f}_{8}} \\
\end{align*}$$
#+end_latex

At this point we have everything needed to generate an optimized code snippet that
can be used to compute density and velocity values given a set of variables containing
a single cell's populations. As a convention we are going to prefix these /current/ population
variables with =f_curr=.

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session :results none

    f_rho = realize_indexed(realize_rho(D), f, populations)
    f_u = [ realize_indexed(realize_u_i(D, i), f, populations) for i in range(D.d) ]
    return CodeBlock(f_rho, *f_u).cse(symbols = numbered_symbols(prefix='m'), optimizations = custom_opti)
#+END_SRC

Both the fluid dynamics implemented by collision steps and boundary conditions as well as functions
for computing moments to e.g. visualize are implemented as GPU kernel functions. In CUDA this means
plain functions marked by the =__global__= specifier. As most kernel share common aspects in their call
requirements and parameter sets we wrap them in =__device__= functions of sensibly named structures.

Calculating the equilibrium distribution of some population $f_i$ requires the evaluation of inner products
between vectors. As there doesn't seem to be a nice way of writing an abstract SymPy expression that both
generates nice LaTeX and can be realized on a concrete lattice we skip the fully abstract step and jump

For initialization of lattice data it often makes sense to choose values that are invariant under this
equilibrium computation. Cells initialized in this way will not change during the collision step
and as such can be considered to model a fluid /at rest/.

** BGK Collision
The BGK collision operators takes a current population $f^{curr}_i$ and /relaxes/ it toward the equilibrium distribution
$f^{eq}_i$ with some rate $\tau$. The result of this process is the new population $f^{next}_i$.

as the foundation for the equilibrium distribution the generated code will assume variables =rho= and =u_i=

** Smagorinsky BGK Collision
Simulation of turbulent flow using plain BGK collisions is possible -- after all turbulence is captured by the Navier-Stokes
equations that in turn are the target equations of our BGK-LB method -- but requires very highly resolved grids. The reason
for this is that turbulence is characterized by the formation of eddies at both very big and very small scales. Most of the
energy is contained in the large scale features but dissipates into heat at the finest scales. To capture turbulent flow we either
have to resolve the grid all the way to these finest scales or implement some kind of model for the characteristics of these
scales in a coarser grid. Computation on such a coarser grid is then also called a large eddy simulation (LES).

One comparably simple model for respresenting the smaller eddies in such a LES is the Smagorinsky subgrid-scale model.
This model yields a expression for computing the /effective relaxation rate/ $\tau_\text{eff}$ on a per-cell basis given the global relaxation
time $\tau$ and a Smagorinsky constant. As the relaxation time in BGK LBM is a function of the viscosity this translates into
computing the effective viscosity using a local strain-rate tensor reconstruction based on the non-equilibrium part of each
cell's populations. This follows the approach laid out by  Yu et al. in cite:yuDNSDecayingIsotropic2005.

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session :results none
tau, smagorinsky = symbols('tau, smagorinsky')
#+END_SRC

The non-equilibrium part is simply the difference between the actual population stored in a cell and the respective
equilibrium population that we relax towards. Using these local non-equilibrium parts to reconstruct the strain-rate
tensor $\Pi_{i,j}^\text{neq}$ is quite convenient as we otherwise would have to employ e.g. a finite difference method just for this.

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session :results none
def pi_neq(D, f, f_eq):
    pi_neq = zeros(D.d, D.d)
    for i, j, k in multirange(D.d, D.d, D.q):
        pi_neq[i,j] += D.c[k][i] * D.c[k][j] * (f[k] - f_eq[k])
    
    return pi_neq
#+END_SRC

To compute the effective relaxation rate we need the norm of this strain-rate tensor.

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session :results none
def pi_neq_norm(D, f, f_eq):
    pi = pi_neq(D, f, f_eq)
    return sqrt(2*multisum(lambda i, j: pi[i,j]**2, D.d, D.d))
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session :results none
def effective_tau(D, f, f_eq, tau, smagorinsky):
    pi_norm = pi_neq_norm(D, f, f_eq)
    return tau + 0.5*(sqrt(tau**2 + 2*sqrt(2)*smagorinsky**2 * pi_norm / D.c_s**4) - tau)
#+END_SRC

Finally the resulting per-cell relaxation time is simply plugged into the existing BGK collision operator to yield the
complete Smagorinsky BGK collision step.

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session :results none
def smagorinsky_bgk_collision_code_block(D, tau, smagorinsky):
    f_rho = realize_indexed(realize_rho(D), f, f_curr)
    f_u = [ realize_indexed(realize_u_i(D, i), f, f_curr) for i in range(D.d) ]
    f_eq = [ realize_f_eq_i(D, i).rhs for i in range(D.q) ]
    eff_tau = effective_tau(D, f_curr, f_eq, tau, smagorinsky)
    f_post_collide = [ bgk_collision(f_curr[i], f_next[i], f_eq[i], eff_tau) for i in range(D.q) ]
    return CodeBlock(f_rho, *f_u, *f_post_collide).cse(optimizations = custom_opti)

* Boundary conditions
Real-world  simulations are limited by the available computational resources. This means that we can not allocate
an infinitely large lattice and consequently we at a minimum need to prescribe some conditions for the outer boundary
of our finite lattice -- even in cases where we only want to simulate a fluid without any obstacles.
In practice we commonly want to do both: Prescribe some inflow and outflow conditions as well as various boundaries
that represent some obstacle geometry. This way we could for example create a virtual wind tunnel where fluid enters
the domain on one side, is kept in line by smooth free slip walls, encounters some obstacle whose aerodynamic
properties we want to investigate and exits the simulation lattice on the other side.
** Bounce Back
To fit bounce back's reputation as the simplest LBM boundary condition we do not require any
fancy expression trickery to generate its code. This boundary condition simply reflects back
all populations the way they came from. As such it models a solid wall with no tangential velocity
at the boundary.

** Moving Wall Bounce Back
Modeling solid unmoving obstacles using e.g. bounce back is nice enough but in practice
we commonly want to induce some kind of movement in our fluids. While this can be done
by e.g. prescribing an inflow velocity using [[*Prescribed Equilibrium][prescribed equilibrium boundaries]], bounce
back can be modified to represent not just a solid wall but also some momentum exerted
on the fluid.

Strictly speaking this should only be used to model tangentially moving walls (such as in the 
[[*Lid-driven Cavity][lid-driven cavity]] example). More complex situations are possible but require boundary
conditions to e.g. track the position of obstacles during the simulation.

This is another special case of the bounce back boundaries where populations are reflected
specularly with respect to a given normal vector instead of simply bouncing them back
the way they came from.

Such a boundary condition is able to represent non-zero tangential /free slip/ velocities.
The mapping between pre- and post-collision velocities is of course specific to each
wall normal. We use tag dispatching for allowing the use to select which kind of wall
each boundary condition call represents.

Following the approach by Bouzidi et al. cite:bouzidiMomentumTransferBoltzmannlattice2001
an improved version of plain bounce back can be formulated using the distance between cell and wall.
This /interpolated/ bounce back condition reconstructs the missing populations using a basic linear
interpolation w.r.t. a precomputed wall distance factor $q$.

$$\begin{align*}
f_i(x_f,t+\delta t) &= 2q f_j(x_f,t) + (1-2q) f_j(x_{f} + \delta x \xi_i,t)  && q \leq \frac{1}{2} \\
f_i(x_f,t+\delta t) &= \frac{1}{2q}f_j(x_f,t) + \left(1 - \frac{1}{2q}\right) f_i(x_f,t) && q > \frac{1}{2}
\end{align*}$$

Note that the case distinction can be unified into a single case by precomputing
distance and wall velocity correction factors.

The cells locations $x_f$, $x_f + \xi_i$  in addition to distance factors $q$, velocity corrections and the
missing population index to be reconstructed are stored in a =InterpolatedBounceBackConfig=

** Prescribed Equilibrium
One way of modeling an open boundary of our simulation domain is to prescribe either the velocity or the density at the wall cell.
To realize this prescription we have to set the missing populations accordingly. The simplest way to that is to set all populations
of the wall cell to the equilibrium values given by velocity and density.
i.e. we have to recover the density if we are given the wall-normal velocity and vice versa.

To do this we will use SymPy for solving the missing moment for a set of unknown populations and the prescribed boundary
condition. As the =solve= function doesn't seem to work with the =Indexed= type we used to represent the population values we
need helper methods for converting between indexed symbols and an array of plain symbols.

#+END_SRC

The prescribed and recovered moments will get an underscore =w= to distinguish them from normal population moments.

This function simply constructs two definitions for the set of missing populations using either the wall velocity or the value of rho.
As these definitions must be equal in a valid system we can solve them for the desired reconstruction of rho.

* Propagation Pattern
Up until now the symbolic expressions and the generated code did not explicitly implement the
second essential part of the LBM algorithm: propagation. Rather the propagation was modelled
abstractly by reading from some population =f_curr= and writing to another population =f_next=.
To remedy this we will now describe how =f_curr= and =f_next= are actually represented in memory.
This representation will then allow /implicit/ propagation by changing the pointers that are used
to access it.

#+BEGIN_SRC cpp :tangle tangle/LLBM/propagate.h
#pragma once

#include "memory.h"
#include "descriptor.h"
#include "kernel/propagate.h"

#include <cuda.h>
#+END_SRC

Our code employs the /Periodic Shift (PS)/ cite:kummerlanderImplicitPropagationDirectly2021 propagation
pattern to perform the streaming step of the LB algorithm. This pattern uses a /Structure of Arrays/ data layout for the
populations where each individual array is viewed as cyclic. The Sweep space filling curve is used as the bijection
between these one dimensional arrays and spatial cell locations. 
As the distance between any two cells along some fixed vector is invariant of the specific cell
locations propagation is equivalent to rotating the population arrays. Such rotation can be
implemented without data transfer by shifting the start pointers in a control structure.

The control structure describes the mapping between cells and memory locations for
a specific point in time. We group all neccessary data into a /LatticeView/ structure.

#+BEGIN_SRC cpp :tangle tangle/LLBM/propagate.h
template <typename DESCRIPTOR, typename S>
struct LatticeView {
  const descriptor::Cuboid<DESCRIPTOR> cuboid;
  S** population;

  __device__ __forceinline__
  S* pop(pop_index_t iPop, std::size_t gid) const;
};
#+END_SRC

This lightweight structure will be passed by-value to any kernel functions and is the only way for
collision operators, functors and boundary conditions to access lattice data.

** Memory
As the population memory layout and propagation algorithm are codependent we implement
them in a single /CyclicPopulationBuffer/ class. This class will manage the \(q\)  individual device-side
cyclic arrays together with their control structure.

#+BEGIN_SRC cpp :tangle tangle/LLBM/propagate.h
template <typename DESCRIPTOR, typename S>
class CyclicPopulationBuffer {
protected:
  const descriptor::Cuboid<DESCRIPTOR> _cuboid;

  const std::size_t _page_size;
  const std::size_t _volume;

  CUmemGenericAllocationHandle _handle[DESCRIPTOR::q];
  CUmemAllocationProp _prop{};
  CUmemAccessDesc _access{};
  CUdeviceptr _ptr;

  SharedVector<S*> _base;
  SharedVector<S*> _population;

  S* device() {
    return reinterpret_cast<S*>(_ptr);
  }

public:
  CyclicPopulationBuffer(descriptor::Cuboid<DESCRIPTOR> cuboid);

  LatticeView<DESCRIPTOR,S> view() {
    return LatticeView<DESCRIPTOR,S>{ _cuboid, _population.device() };
  }

  void stream();

};
#+END_SRC

In order to enable rotation of cyclic arrays by shifting only the start pointer in /LatticeView/ we need
to perform the index wrapping at the end of the physical array as efficiently as possible. In turns
out that this can be done at virtually no cost by using the in-hardware virtual address translation
logic. Doing so requires the array sizes to be exact multiples of the device page size.

#+BEGIN_SRC cpp :tangle tangle/LLBM/propagate.h
std::size_t getDevicePageSize(int device_id=-1) {
  if (device_id == -1) {
    cudaGetDevice(&device_id);

  CUmemAllocationProp prop = {};
  prop.type = CU_MEM_ALLOCATION_TYPE_PINNED;

pointers for the control strucuture we are ready to place two consecutive views of the same
physical array in virtual memory.

To do this we first need to know which device is currently selected.

#+BEGIN_SRC cpp :tangle tangle/LLBM/propagate.h
  int device_id = -1;
  cudaGetDevice(&device_id);
#+END_SRC

Using this device ID, a device-pinned address area large enough to fit two full views of the
lattice can be reserved.

#+BEGIN_SRC cpp :tangle tangle/LLBM/propagate.h
  _prop.type = CU_MEM_ALLOCATION_TYPE_PINNED;
  _prop.location.type = CU_MEM_LOCATION_TYPE_DEVICE;
  _prop.location.id = device_id;
  cuMemAddressReserve(&_ptr, 2 * _volume * DESCRIPTOR::q, 0, 0, 0);
#+END_SRC

The /structure of cyclic arrays/ required for our chosen propagation pattern is then
mapped into this address area.

#+BEGIN_SRC cpp :tangle tangle/LLBM/propagate.h
  for (unsigned iPop=0; iPop < DESCRIPTOR::q; ++iPop) {
    // per-population handle until cuMemMap accepts non-zero offset
    cuMemCreate(&_handle[iPop], _volume, &_prop, 0); 
    cuMemMap(_ptr + iPop * 2 * _volume,           _volume, 0, _handle[iPop], 0);
    cuMemMap(_ptr + iPop * 2 * _volume + _volume, _volume, 0, _handle[iPop], 0);
  }
#+END_SRC

Actually reading from and writing to locations within this memory depends on setting
the correct access flags. Once this is done we are ready to zero-initialize the buffer.

#+BEGIN_SRC cpp :tangle tangle/LLBM/propagate.h
  _access.location.type = CU_MEM_LOCATION_TYPE_DEVICE;
  _access.location.id = 0;
  _access.flags = CU_MEM_ACCESS_FLAGS_PROT_READWRITE;
  cuMemSetAccess(_ptr, 2 * _volume * DESCRIPTOR::q, &_access, 1);
  cuMemsetD8(_ptr, 0, 2 * _volume * DESCRIPTOR::q);
#+END_SRC

As the rotation of the cyclic arrays is to be realized by shifting the per-population start pointers
we also need to store those somewhere.

#+BEGIN_SRC cpp :tangle tangle/LLBM/propagate.h
  for (unsigned iPop=0; iPop < DESCRIPTOR::q; ++iPop) {
    _base[iPop] = device() + iPop * 2 * (_volume / sizeof(S));
    _population[iPop] = _base[iPop] + iPop * ((_volume / sizeof(S)) / DESCRIPTOR::q);
  }

  _base.syncDeviceFromHost();
  _population.syncDeviceFromHost();
}
#+END_SRC

** Access
The common interface of most of out GPU kernels is to accept an array of current propulations and
write the new populations to another array. This way we can control where the populations are read
from and stored to at a central location.

#+BEGIN_SRC cpp :tangle tangle/LLBM/propagate.h
template <typename DESCRIPTOR, typename S>
__device__ __forceinline__
S* LatticeView<DESCRIPTOR,S>::pop(pop_index_t iPop, std::size_t gid) const {
  return population[iPop] + gid;
}
#+END_SRC

In practice a slight performance improvement can be observed on some GPUs when only evaluating
this addition once per-kernel and caching the resulting locations.

#+NAME: read-f-curr
#+BEGIN_SRC cpp
S* preshifted_f[DESCRIPTOR::q];
for (unsigned iPop=0; iPop < DESCRIPTOR::q; ++iPop) {
  preshifted_f[iPop] = lattice.pop(iPop, gid);
  f_curr[iPop] = *preshifted_f[iPop];
}
#+END_SRC

At this point the various kernel functions can execute a generic operator on a cell's
populations without knowing anything about where the cell data is stored.

The preshifted pointers are then reused to perform the store operations after
the generic operator implementation is done with its work.

#+NAME: write-f-next
#+BEGIN_SRC cpp
for (unsigned iPop=0; iPop < DESCRIPTOR::q; ++iPop) {
  *preshifted_f[iPop] = f_next[iPop];
}
#+END_SRC

** Update
#+BEGIN_SRC cpp :tangle tangle/LLBM/propagate.h :noweb no
template <typename DESCRIPTOR, typename S>
void CyclicPopulationBuffer<DESCRIPTOR,S>::stream() {
  propagate<DESCRIPTOR,S><<<1,1>>>(view(), _base.device(), _volume / sizeof(S));
}
#+END_SRC

The =propagate= kernel shifts the start pointers of each population array by the respective
discrete velocity offset and performs wrapping if necessary. This ensures that the actual
population accesses are always presented a contiguous view of the full array.

#+BEGIN_SRC cpp :tangle tangle/LLBM/kernel/propagate.h
#pragma once

template <typename DESCRIPTOR, typename S>
class LatticeView;

template <typename DESCRIPTOR, typename S>
__global__ void propagate(LatticeView<DESCRIPTOR,S> lattice, S** base, std::size_t size) {
#+END_SRC

It is very important to use the correct types when doing pointer arithmetic.

Rotation is performed by shifting the start position of each population array by the invariant
neighborhood distance given by its discrete velocity vector. As this operation can cross the
array boundaries special care has to be taken in wrapping these invalid positions back into
the array.

#+BEGIN_SRC cpp :tangle tangle/LLBM/kernel/propagate.h
  for (unsigned iPop=0; iPop < DESCRIPTOR::q; ++iPop) {
    std::ptrdiff_t shift = -descriptor::offset<DESCRIPTOR>(lattice.cuboid, iPop);

    lattice.population[iPop] += shift;

    if (lattice.population[iPop] < base[iPop]) {
      lattice.population[iPop] += size;
    } else if (lattice.population[iPop] + size > base[iPop] + 2*size) {
      lattice.population[iPop] -= size;
    }
  }
}
#+END_SRC

* Geometry Modeling
One straight forward way to define arbitrarily complex geometries that are amenable to both
boundary parametrization and usage in just-in-time visualization are /signed distance functions/.

$$d : \mathbb{R}^d \to \mathbb{R}$$

If such a function $d$ is constructed in a way to return the shortest distance to the obstacle surface
for every point in space then those distances are positive for any point outside of the obstacle and
negative for any point inside of it. This is where the /signed/ in SDF comes from.

Note that SDFs do not in general return the true shortest distance to the surface as measured by
e.g. the Euclidean norm but rather a bound of the distance. This is especially the case when one
combines multiple distance functions using boolean operators. Luckily we can still approximate
the true distance using iteration.

#+BEGIN_SRC cpp :tangle tangle/LLBM/sdf.h
#pragma once
#include <vector_types.h>
#include <cuda-samples/Common/helper_math.h>
#+END_SRC

** Sphere tracing
Sphere tracing provides an approximation of the true euclidean distance to the surface defined by a SDF in the direction
of some ray even when the provided distance is only a bound of the true distance. For a lower bound this is straight forward
to see as the convergence may take longer if shortest distance sphere is not as large as possible but it will still happen after
a sufficiently high number of iterations. An upper bound SDF can be compensated by restricting the maximum step distance.
This is also useful in the other cases as we may /overshoot/ the true intersection otherwise.

#+BEGIN_SRC cpp :tangle tangle/LLBM/sdf.h
template <typename SDF, typename V>
__device__ __host__
float approximateDistance(SDF sdf, V origin, V dir, float d0, float d1, float eps=1e-2, unsigned N=128) {
  float distance = d0;
  float delta = (d1-d0) / N;
  for (unsigned i=0; i < N; ++i) {
    float d = sdf(origin + distance*dir);
    if (d < eps) {
      return distance;
    }
    distance += d;
    if (distance > d1) {
      return d1;
    }
  }
  return d1;
}
#+END_SRC

** Constructive solid geometry
A convenient way for generating SDFs for arbitrary shapes is to construct them by combining
various primitives such as spheres and boxes using boolean operators such as addition and
substraction.

#+BEGIN_SRC cpp :tangle tangle/LLBM/sdf.h
namespace sdf {
#+END_SRC
*** Primitives
A sphere is arguably the simplest shape to model using signed distance functions as the euklidean norm of a vector
stays constant for spherical surfaces centered on the origin. This is also the definition that is often used when defining
spherical sets in mathematics.

#+BEGIN_SRC cpp :tangle tangle/LLBM/sdf.h
template <typename V>
__device__ __host__ float sphere(V p, float r) {
  return length(p) - r;
}
#+END_SRC

Note that a 2D sphere SDF can also be used to construct cylinders in 3D space.

#+BEGIN_SRC cpp :tangle tangle/LLBM/sdf.h
__device__ __host__ float box(float3 p, float3 b) {
  float3 q = fabs(p) - b;
  return length(fmaxf(q,make_float3(0))) + fmin(fmax(q.x,fmax(q.y,q.z)),0);
}
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC cpp :tangle tangle/LLBM/sdf.h
__device__ __host__ float cylinder(float3 p, float r, float h) {
	return fmax(length(make_float2(p.x,p.y)) - r, fabs(p.z) - 0.5*h);
}
#+END_SRC

*** Operators
It makes intuitive sense that the union of two SDFs can be taken by using the minimum of the respective distances.

#+BEGIN_SRC cpp :tangle tangle/LLBM/sdf.h
__device__ __host__ float add(float a, float b) {
  return fmin(a, b);
}
#+END_SRC

The intersection of two SDFs, i.e. their shared parts, can be generated by using the maximum of the distances.
For the intersecting part both must be below zero but if any distance is positive the sample point can obviously
not be part of the intersection.

#+BEGIN_SRC cpp :tangle tangle/LLBM/sdf.h
__device__ __host__ float intersect(float a, float b) {
  return fmax(a, b);
}
#+END_SRC

The result of substracting one SDF from the other is composed by inverting the SDF to be substracted and
taking the intersection of this inversion and the other SDF.

#+BEGIN_SRC cpp :tangle tangle/LLBM/sdf.h
__device__ __host__ float sub(float a, float b) {
  return intersect(-a, b);
}
#+END_SRC

Smooth versions of these constructive operators exist.

#+BEGIN_SRC cpp :tangle tangle/LLBM/sdf.h
__device__ __host__ float sadd(float a, float b, float k) {
  float h = clamp(0.5f + 0.5f*(b-a)/k, 0.0f, 1.0f);
  return lerp(b, a, h) - k*h*(1.f-h);
}
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC cpp :tangle tangle/LLBM/sdf.h
__device__ __host__ float ssub(float a, float b, float k) {
  float h = clamp(0.5f - 0.5f*(b+a)/k, 0.f, 1.f);
  return lerp(b, -a, h) + k*h*(1.f-h);
}
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC cpp :tangle tangle/LLBM/sdf.h
__device__ __host__ float sintersect(float a, float b, float k) {
  float h = clamp(0.5f - 0.5f*(b-a)/k, 0.f, 1.f);
  return lerp(b, a, h) + k*h*(1.f-h);
}
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC cpp :tangle tangle/LLBM/sdf.h
}
#+END_SRC

** Boundary conditions
We can now use the distance finding algorithm to provide a convenient interface for generating [[*Interpolated Bounce Back][interpolated bounce back]]
boundary parameters to fit a given SDF. This way we ensure that any displayed geometry actually fits what we simulate.

The /bogus distance/ warnings are generated when the cell's position is exactly on top of the boundary 
or farther away then the next neighbor cell in the search direction. These cases should be handled by
other boundary conditions if we are interested in the best possible results.

* Runtime Context
** Memory
#+BEGIN_SRC cpp :tangle tangle/LLBM/memory.h
#pragma once

#include <memory>
#include <vector>
#include <cstring>
#+END_SRC

Most memory of our simulation resides solely on the GPU. While we already defined a data structure for
the population data in the propagation section we also need buffers for additional data such as functor
results or material numbers.

#+BEGIN_SRC cpp :tangle tangle/LLBM/memory.h
template <typename T>
class DeviceBuffer {
protected:
  const std::size_t _size;
  T* _data;
#+END_SRC

Note that the value of the =_data= pointer is going to be a address in GPU memory. We only expose access to it
via a =device()= member function and not e.g. via an implicit conversion operator as it is very important to
be clear whether one refers to device or host memory. GPU kernels can only access device memory but are
called from the host which is why the value of the =_data= member is not itself stored on the device but on the
host.

#+BEGIN_SRC cpp :tangle tangle/LLBM/memory.h
public:
  DeviceBuffer(std::size_t size):
    _size(size) {
    cudaMalloc(&_data, _size*sizeof(T));
    cudaMemset(_data, 0, _size*sizeof(T));
  }
  <<device-buffer-load-from-plain-data>>
  <<device-buffer-load-from-std-vector>>
 
  ~DeviceBuffer() {
    cudaFree(_data);
  }

  T* device() {
    return _data;
  }

  std::size_t size() const {
    return _size;
  }
};
#+END_SRC

The most generic way of initializing this device data structure from the host side is to pass a plain memory reference consisting
of a pointer and the size.

#+NAME: device-buffer-load-from-plain-data
#+BEGIN_SRC cpp :eval no
DeviceBuffer(const T* data, std::size_t size):
  DeviceBuffer(size) {
  cudaMemcpy(_data, data, size*sizeof(T), cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);
}
#+END_SRC

For convenience we also implement a constructor to initialize a =DeviceBuffer= using a =std::vector= stored on the host.
Note that for this to work the =std::vector= specialization has to guarantee contiguous storage. i.e. this will not work for
=std::vector<bool>= .

#+NAME: device-buffer-load-from-std-vector
#+BEGIN_SRC cpp :eval no
DeviceBuffer(const std::vector<T>& data):
  DeviceBuffer(data.data(), data.size()) { }
#+END_SRC

While this should be enough to contain data such as lists of cell IDs or simulation results, some of this data will have to be
communicated between device and host. For this purpose we implement a =SharedVector= that maintains equally sized
memory buffers on both the GPU and the host.

#+BEGIN_SRC cpp :tangle tangle/LLBM/memory.h
template <typename T>
class SharedVector : public DeviceBuffer<T> {
private:
  std::unique_ptr<T[]> _host_data;
 
public:
  SharedVector(std::size_t size):
    DeviceBuffer<T>(size),
    _host_data(new T[size]{}) {
    syncDeviceFromHost();
  }

  T* host() {
    return _host_data.get();
  }

  T& operator[](unsigned i) {
    return host()[i];
  }

  void syncHostFromDevice() {
    cudaMemcpy(_host_data.get(), this->_data, this->_size*sizeof(T), cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost);
  }

  void syncDeviceFromHost() {
    cudaMemcpy(this->_data, _host_data.get(), this->_size*sizeof(T), cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);
  }

};
#+END_SRC

When visualizing data using e.g. volumetric rendering it is very convenient to access this data as textures.
Amongst other things this provides very fast in-hardware interpolation between individual /pixels/.

#+BEGIN_SRC cpp :tangle tangle/LLBM/memory.h
template <typename T>
class DeviceTexture {
protected:
  cudaExtent _extent;
  cudaArray_t _array;

  cudaChannelFormatDesc _channel_desc;
  cudaResourceDesc _res_desc;
  cudaTextureDesc  _tex_desc;

  cudaTextureObject_t _texture;
  cudaSurfaceObject_t _surface;
#+END_SRC

The setup of such textures is quite a bit more involved that for plain GPU memory. The reason for this is
that a texture is actually a /view/ for data that resides in a special area of GPU memory. So we need
to first allocate the data as a 3D array of some channel description that defines the scalar type stored
by the texture. This 3D array then has to be connected to a texture object by declaring appropriate
ressource and texture description structures. The latter of which defines how the texture is addressed
and interpolated.

#+BEGIN_SRC cpp :tangle tangle/LLBM/memory.h
public:
  DeviceTexture(std::size_t nX, std::size_t nY, std::size_t nZ=0):
    _extent(make_cudaExtent(nX,nY,nZ)),
    _channel_desc(cudaCreateChannelDesc<float>()) {
    cudaMalloc3DArray(&_array, &_channel_desc, _extent);

    std::memset(&_res_desc, 0, sizeof(_res_desc));
    _res_desc.resType = cudaResourceTypeArray;
    _res_desc.res.array.array = _array;

    std::memset(&_tex_desc, 0, sizeof(_tex_desc));
    _res_desc.resType = cudaResourceTypeArray;
    _tex_desc.addressMode[0]   = cudaAddressModeClamp;
    _tex_desc.addressMode[1]   = cudaAddressModeClamp;
    _tex_desc.addressMode[2]   = cudaAddressModeClamp;
    _tex_desc.filterMode       = cudaFilterModeLinear;
    _tex_desc.normalizedCoords = 0;

    cudaCreateTextureObject(&_texture, &_res_desc, &_tex_desc, NULL);
    cudaCreateSurfaceObject(&_surface, &_res_desc);
  }

  DeviceTexture(descriptor::CuboidD<3> c):
    DeviceTexture(c.nX, c.nY, c.nZ) { }
  
  ~DeviceTexture() {

    return _texture;
  }

  cudaSurfaceObject_t getSurface() const {

** Descriptor Structure
Not all parts of our simulation code can be statically resolved during the tangling of this file. e.g. we might want to iterate
over all population IDs or calculate opposite indices at runtime. For this purpose we gather some data from our Python
descriptor structure into a C++ header.

#+NAME: cpp-descriptor-template
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE cpp
struct ${D.name} {
  static constexpr unsigned d = ${D.d};
  static constexpr unsigned q = ${D.q};
};
#+END_EXAMPLE

Each descriptor is identified by such an appropriately named struct in our C++ code. The struct stores the dimension and number of characteristic velocities and
its type is used as a template argument in any further descriptor-dependent code.

** Cuboid
Our LBM code assumes that all lattices are axis-aligned cuboids with a discrete extent of cells along
each spatial dimension. Such a structure describes the regular lattice on which the population
values will be defined. As these populations need to be stored in memory we need some mapping
between their spatial locations and a linear in-memory location.

This linear location is given by a =gid= function that implements a sweep space filling curve.

** Lattice
The =Lattice= class bundles an on-device population buffer storing the actual data
with the =PropagationControl= for performing the LBM streaming step and provides
various methods for applying operators and functors.

  return _cuboid;
}

void stream() {
  _population.stream();
}
#+END_SRC

** Operator Application
All of our kernel functions can be grouped into three categories: Kernels that are applied to cell IDs, kernels that are applied
to entries of a list and kernels that are applied to a mask in a spatial configuration. As we are going to employ C++ tag dispatching
for selecting the appropriate wrapper functions to call the kernel operators we define a set of structs to distinguish the overloads:

#+BEGIN_SRC cpp :noweb no :tangle tangle/LLBM/call_tag.h
#pragma once

namespace tag {

struct call_by_cell_id { };
struct call_by_list_index { };
struct call_by_spatial_cell_mask { };

struct post_process_by_list_index { };
struct post_process_by_spatial_cell_mask { };

}
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC cpp :noweb no :tangle tangle/LLBM/lattice.h
template <typename... OPERATOR>
void apply(OPERATOR... ops) {
  const auto block_size = 32;
  const auto block_count = (_cuboid.volume + block_size - 1) / block_size;
  kernel::call_operators<DESCRIPTOR,T,S,OPERATOR...><<<block_count,block_size>>>(
    _population.view(), ops...
  );
}
#+END_SRC

The dispatching method =apply= calls the appropriate overload by instantiating the type defined by =OPERATOR::call_tag= and passing
it on to =call_operator= alongside any other arguments. Note that the dispatching function and the overloaded functions have to be of
different names to prevent infinite recursion as the variadic parameter pack could of course also capture tags.

#+BEGIN_SRC cpp :noweb no :tangle tangle/LLBM/lattice.h
template <typename OPERATOR, typename... ARGS>
void apply(ARGS&&... args) {
  call_operator<OPERATOR>(typename OPERATOR::call_tag{}, std::forward<ARGS&&>(args)...);
}
#+END_SRC

As cell IDs can be extracted from both a list of them and a mask applied to the full set we can use the different types of device buffer
specializations to distinguish between masked and list-based applications of cell-ID-accepting kernels.

#+BEGIN_SRC cpp :noweb no :tangle tangle/LLBM/lattice.h
template <typename OPERATOR, typename... ARGS>
void call_operator(tag::call_by_cell_id, DeviceBuffer<std::size_t>& cells, ARGS... args) {
  const auto block_size = 32;
  const auto block_count = (cells.size() + block_size - 1) / block_size;
  kernel::call_operator<OPERATOR,DESCRIPTOR,T,S,ARGS...><<<block_count,block_size>>>(
    _population.view(), cells.device(), cells.size(), std::forward<ARGS>(args)...
  );
}
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC cpp :noweb no :tangle tangle/LLBM/lattice.h
template <typename OPERATOR, typename... ARGS>
void call_operator(tag::call_by_cell_id, DeviceBuffer<bool>& mask, ARGS... args) {
  const auto block_size = 32;
  const auto block_count = (_cuboid.volume + block_size - 1) / block_size;
  kernel::call_operator<OPERATOR,DESCRIPTOR,T,S,ARGS...><<<block_count,block_size>>>(
    _population.view(), mask.device(), std::forward<ARGS>(args)...
  );
}
#+END_SRC

The list-based application doesn't perform any detection of device buffer types but can be thought of as simply iterating
over =count= elements and passing the current index to the individual device operator. This is useful when calling e.g. the
interpolated bounce back kernel as there is no 1:1 mapping between threads and cells to be found there.

#+BEGIN_SRC cpp :noweb no :tangle tangle/LLBM/lattice.h
template <typename OPERATOR, typename... ARGS>
void call_operator(tag::call_by_list_index, std::size_t count, ARGS... args) {
  const auto block_size = 32;
  const auto block_count = (count + block_size - 1) / block_size;
  kernel::call_operator_using_list<OPERATOR,DESCRIPTOR,T,S,ARGS...><<<block_count,block_size>>>(

  const auto block_size = 32;
  const auto block_count = (cells.size() + block_size - 1) / block_size;
  kernel::call_functor<FUNCTOR,DESCRIPTOR,T,S,ARGS...><<<block_count,block_size>>>(
    _population.view(), cells.device(), cells.size(), std::forward<ARGS>(args)...
  );
}
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC cpp :noweb no :tangle tangle/LLBM/lattice.h

void call_functor(tag::call_by_cell_id, DeviceBuffer<bool>& mask, ARGS... args) {
  const auto block_size = 32;
  const auto block_count = (_cuboid.volume + block_size - 1) / block_size;
  kernel::call_functor<FUNCTOR,DESCRIPTOR,T,S,ARGS...><<<block_count,block_size>>>(
    _population.view(), mask.device(), std::forward<ARGS>(args)...
  );
}
#+END_SRC

When we evaluate functors on the full domain to e.g. extract velocity norms into a 3d texture for volumetric visualization,
access to the spatial location of each cell is required. We could implement this by inverting each cell ID but it is both
more efficient and more clear to use the possibility of calling CUDA kernels in a 3D grid for this kind of work.

#+BEGIN_SRC cpp :noweb no :tangle tangle/LLBM/lattice.h
template <typename FUNCTOR, typename... ARGS>
void call_functor(tag::call_by_spatial_cell_mask, DeviceBuffer<bool>& mask, ARGS... args) {
  const dim3 block(32,8,4);
  const dim3 grid((_cuboid.nX + block.x - 1) / block.x,
                  (_cuboid.nY + block.y - 1) / block.y,
                  (_cuboid.nZ + block.z - 1) / block.z);
  kernel::call_spatial_functor<FUNCTOR,DESCRIPTOR,T,S,ARGS...><<<grid,block>>>(
    _population.view(), mask.device(), std::forward<ARGS>(args)...
  );
}
#+END_SRC

Sometimes we only want to do post-processing on e.g. the velocity moments without recalculating anything from the
populations. Strictly speaking such a kernel should not be called from the control class but as it is quite convenient
in practice we do so anyway:

#+BEGIN_SRC cpp :noweb no :tangle tangle/LLBM/lattice.h
template <typename OPERATOR, typename... ARGS>
void helper(ARGS&&... args) {
  tagged_helper<OPERATOR>(typename OPERATOR::call_tag{}, std::forward<ARGS&&>(args)...);
}
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC cpp :noweb no :tangle tangle/LLBM/lattice.h
template <typename OPERATOR, typename... ARGS>
void tagged_helper(tag::post_process_by_list_index, std::size_t count, ARGS... args) {
  const auto block_size = 32;
  const auto block_count = (count + block_size - 1) / block_size;
  kernel::call_operator_using_list<OPERATOR,DESCRIPTOR,T,S,ARGS...><<<block_count,block_size>>>(
    DESCRIPTOR(), count, std::forward<ARGS>(args)...
  );
}
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC cpp :noweb no :tangle tangle/LLBM/lattice.h
template <typename OPERATOR, typename... ARGS>
void tagged_helper(tag::post_process_by_spatial_cell_mask, DeviceBuffer<bool>& mask, ARGS... args) {
  const dim3 block(32,8,4);
  const dim3 grid((_cuboid.nX + block.x - 1) / block.x,
                  (_cuboid.nY + block.y - 1) / block.y,
                  (_cuboid.nZ + block.z - 1) / block.z);
  kernel::call_spatial_operator<OPERATOR,DESCRIPTOR,T,S,ARGS...><<<grid,block>>>(
    _cuboid, mask.device(), std::forward<ARGS>(args)...
  );
}

};
#+END_SRC

Generally speaking we want to avoid control flow branching inside of GPU kernels. However it can
make sense to group multiple masked operators into a single lattice pass of a single kernel using some
small number of branches instead of launching a separate branch-free kernel for each operator.

In order to generate a single kernel from multiple operators curried with their respective arguments
we implement a small =Operator= helper class.

#+BEGIN_SRC cpp :noweb no :tangle tangle/LLBM/operator.h
#pragma once

#include <tuple>

template <typename OPERATOR, typename... ARGS>
struct Operator {
  bool* const mask;
  const std::tuple<ARGS...> config;

  Operator(OPERATOR, DeviceBuffer<bool>& m, ARGS... args):
    mask(m.device()),
    config(args...) { }
#+END_SRC

This =Operator= wrapper stores both the mask pointer and any arguments for a given =OPERATOR= type.
The arguments will be passed to the actual =OPERATOR::apply= by the following proxy method for
any masked cell index.

#+BEGIN_SRC cpp :noweb no :tangle tangle/LLBM/operator.h
  template <typename DESCRIPTOR, typename T, typename S>
  __device__ bool apply(DESCRIPTOR d, S f_curr[DESCRIPTOR::q], S f_next[DESCRIPTOR::q], std::size_t gid) const {
    if (mask[gid]) {
      std::apply([](auto... args) { OPERATOR::template apply<T,S>(args...); },
                 std::tuple_cat(std::make_tuple(d, f_curr, f_next, gid), config));
      return true;
    } else {
      return false;
    }
  }
};
#+END_SRC

Finally a deduction guide can be used to remove some of the visual cruft of declaring =Operator= instances in
the application code.

#+BEGIN_SRC cpp :noweb no :tangle tangle/LLBM/operator.h
template <typename OPERATOR, typename... ARGS>
Operator(OPERATOR, DeviceBuffer<bool>&, ARGS... args) -> Operator<OPERATOR,std::remove_reference_t<ARGS>...>;
#+END_SRC

** Kernel Execution
#+BEGIN_SRC cpp :tangle tangle/LLBM/kernel/executor.h
#pragma once

#include <LLBM/operator.h>

namespace kernel {
#+END_SRC

In this section we are finally implementing the actual kernels to be called by CUDA. These
kernels are plain functions marked with the =__global__= declaration specifier and called
using a special syntax for declaring the desired thread layout. The actual operators and
functors are abstracted in separate named structures implementing as generic an interface
as possible. Due to this the main work here will be to handle some GPU kernel specifics and
to read and write the populations as required by the operator's call type.

#+BEGIN_SRC cpp :tangle tangle/LLBM/kernel/executor.h
template <typename OPERATOR, typename DESCRIPTOR, typename T, typename S, typename... ARGS>
__global__ void call_operator(
    LatticeView<DESCRIPTOR,S> lattice
  , std::size_t* cells
  , std::size_t  cell_count
  , ARGS... args
) {
  const std::size_t index = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  if (!(index < cell_count)) {
      return;
  }
  const std::size_t gid = cells[index];

  S f_curr[DESCRIPTOR::q];
  S f_next[DESCRIPTOR::q];
  <<read-f-curr>>
  OPERATOR::template apply<T,S>(DESCRIPTOR(), f_curr, f_next, gid, std::forward<ARGS>(args)...);
  <<write-f-next>>
}
#+END_SRC

Besides applying an operator to each member of a cell list we also want the possibility
of using a mask instead. Doing this reduces the required memory bandwidth for large
ratios between masked and unmasked cells.

#+BEGIN_SRC cpp :tangle tangle/LLBM/kernel/executor.h
template <typename OPERATOR, typename DESCRIPTOR, typename T, typename S, typename... ARGS>
__global__ void call_operator(
    LatticeView<DESCRIPTOR,S> lattice
  , bool* mask
  , ARGS... args
) {
  const std::size_t gid = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  if (!(gid < lattice.cuboid.volume) || !mask[gid]) {
      return;
  }

  S f_curr[DESCRIPTOR::q];
  S f_next[DESCRIPTOR::q];
  <<read-f-curr>>
  OPERATOR::template apply<T,S>(DESCRIPTOR(), f_curr, f_next, gid, std::forward<ARGS>(args)...);
  <<write-f-next>>
}
#+END_SRC

Of course the same argument holds for read-only functors where we in most cases only want
to compute moments for the bulk cells.

#+BEGIN_SRC cpp :tangle tangle/LLBM/kernel/executor.h
template <typename FUNCTOR, typename DESCRIPTOR, typename T, typename S, typename... ARGS>
__global__ void call_functor(
    LatticeView<DESCRIPTOR,S> lattice
  , bool* mask
  , ARGS... args
) {
  const std::size_t gid = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  if (!(gid < lattice.cuboid.volume) || !mask[gid]) {
      return;
  }

  S f_curr[DESCRIPTOR::q];
  <<read-f-curr>>
  FUNCTOR::template apply<T,S>(DESCRIPTOR(), f_curr, gid, std::forward<ARGS>(args)...);
}
#+END_SRC

A list of curried =Operator= instances passed as a variadic argument pack can be processed
using C++17's fold expressions. Note that we use the return value of the operator proxy calls
to perform short circuting if the currently folded call applied. This makes sense as masks
should be disjunctive in all cases -- otherwise multiple collision steps or boundary conditions
would be applied to the same cell during the same timestep.

#+BEGIN_SRC cpp :tangle tangle/LLBM/kernel/executor.h
template <typename DESCRIPTOR, typename T, typename S, typename... OPERATOR>
__global__ void call_operators(
    LatticeView<DESCRIPTOR,S> lattice
  , OPERATOR... ops
) {
  const std::size_t gid = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  if (!(gid < lattice.cuboid.volume)) {
      return;
  }

  S f_curr[DESCRIPTOR::q];
  S f_next[DESCRIPTOR::q];
  <<read-f-curr>>
  (ops.template apply<DESCRIPTOR,T,S>(DESCRIPTOR(), f_curr, f_next, gid) || ... || false);
  <<write-f-next>>
}
#+END_SRC

Not all operators fit into the a /one-application-per-cell/ framework. e.g. interpolated bounce
back boundaries are more naturally expressed in a /one-application-per-missing-population/
approach.

Even more general is the following caller kernel that doesn't assume anything about the
lattice data required or written to by the wrapped operator. This is mostly used for easily
calling post-processing kernels that do not directly operate on lattice data.

}

For some post-processing operators and functors it is convenient to apply them in
a spatial setting where the threads are mapped in a 3D grid by CUDA. e.g. this is
used when writing data into the 3D textures used by our ray marcher.

#+BEGIN_SRC cpp :tangle tangle/LLBM/kernel/executor.h
template <typename FUNCTOR, typename DESCRIPTOR, typename T, typename S, typename... ARGS>
__global__ void call_spatial_functor(

  const std::size_t iY = blockIdx.y * blockDim.y + threadIdx.y;
  const std::size_t iZ = blockIdx.z * blockDim.z + threadIdx.z;
  if (!(iX < lattice.cuboid.nX && iY < lattice.cuboid.nY && iZ < lattice.cuboid.nZ)) {

  }

Again, as some helper operators such as the one used for shear layer thresholding do not
need direct lattice access, an appropriate wrapper is provided.

  const std::size_t iY = blockIdx.y * blockDim.y + threadIdx.y;
  const std::size_t iZ = blockIdx.z * blockDim.z + threadIdx.z;
  if (!(iX < cuboid.nX && iY < cuboid.nY && iZ < cuboid.nZ)) {
      return;
  }
  const std::size_t gid = descriptor::gid(cuboid,iX,iY,iZ);

** Cell List Generation
Each call to e.g. our collision kernel operates on a subset of cells represented by their IDs.
To ensure that these subsets are disjoint and that we do not perform e.g. both a bulk
collision and some boundary handling on the same cell we maintain a map of material
numbers on the host.

#+NAME: cell-materials-class
#+BEGIN_SRC cpp :tangle tangle/LLBM/materials.h
#pragma once

#include "memory.h"
#include "sdf.h"

template <typename DESCRIPTOR>
class CellMaterials : public SharedVector<int> {
private:
  const descriptor::Cuboid<DESCRIPTOR> _cuboid;
  int* const _materials;

public:
  CellMaterials(descriptor::Cuboid<DESCRIPTOR> cuboid):
    SharedVector<int>(cuboid.volume),
    _cuboid(cuboid),
    _materials(this->host()) { }

  template <typename F>
  CellMaterials(descriptor::Cuboid<DESCRIPTOR> cuboid, F f):
    CellMaterials(cuboid) {
    set(f);
  }

  descriptor::Cuboid<DESCRIPTOR> cuboid() const {
    return _cuboid;
  };
 
  <<cell-materials-basic-access>>
  <<cell-materials-fancy-setters>>
  <<cell-materials-get-list>>
  <<cell-materials-get-mask>>
  <<cell-materials-missing-links>>
};
#+END_SRC

This map assigns exactly one material number to each individual cell and allows extracting
a sorted list of all IDs belonging to a specific material number as a device buffer.

#+NAME: cell-materials-get-list
#+BEGIN_SRC cpp :eval no
DeviceBuffer<std::size_t> list_of_material(int material) {
	std::vector<std::size_t> cells;
	for (std::size_t iCell=0; iCell < _cuboid.volume; ++iCell) {
		if (_materials[iCell] == material) {
			cells.emplace_back(iCell);
		}
	}
	return DeviceBuffer<std::size_t>(cells);
}
#+END_SRC

Of course we also need some basic way of manipulating the material number assignments:

#+NAME: cell-materials-basic-access
#+BEGIN_SRC cpp :eval no
int get(std::size_t iCell) const {
  return _materials[iCell];
}

void set(std::size_t iCell, int material) {
  _materials[iCell] = material;
}
#+END_SRC

In practice we do not want to set each number /by hand/ but want to set them in bulk, e.g. using
lambda expressions that are evaluated for each cell:

#+NAME: cell-materials-fancy-setters
#+BEGIN_SRC cpp :eval no
template <typename F>
void set(F f) {
  for (std::size_t iCell=0; iCell < _cuboid.volume; ++iCell) {
    set(iCell, f(gidInverse(_cuboid, iCell)));
  }
}

template <typename S>
void sdf(S distance, int material, float eps=1e-2) {
  for (std::size_t iCell=0; iCell < _cuboid.volume; ++iCell) {
    auto p = gidInverseSmooth(_cuboid, iCell);
    if (distance(p) < eps) {
      set(iCell, material);
    }
  }
}

void clean(int material) {
  for (std::size_t iCell=0; iCell < _cuboid.volume; ++iCell) {
    if (get(iCell) == material) {
      if (_cuboid.isInside(iCell)) {
        bool surrounded = true;
        for (unsigned iPop=0; iPop < DESCRIPTOR::q; ++iPop) {
          int m = get(descriptor::neighbor<DESCRIPTOR>(_cuboid, iCell, iPop));
          surrounded &= m == material || m == 0;
        }
        if (surrounded) {
          set(iCell, 0);
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
#+END_SRC

In some cases, e.g. when operating on the bulk of cells during the collision step, it is
preferable to apply a kernel over the whole domain and select the desired subset using
a boolean mask. Such masks are easily generated from material numbers.

#+NAME: cell-materials-get-mask
#+BEGIN_SRC cpp :eval no
DeviceBuffer<bool> mask_of_material(int material) {
  std::unique_ptr<bool[]> mask(new bool[_cuboid.volume]{});
	for (std::size_t iCell=0; iCell < _cuboid.volume; ++iCell) {
    mask[iCell] = (_materials[iCell] == material);
	}
	return DeviceBuffer<bool>(mask.get(), _cuboid.volume);
}
#+END_SRC

For boundaries such as interpolated bounce back we need to identify the /missing links/
between two material numbers. i.e. the pairs of propagation-adjacent cells of given
type.

#+NAME: cell-materials-missing-links
#+BEGIN_SRC cpp :eval no
std::size_t get_link_count(int bulk, int solid) {
  std::size_t count = 0;
  for (pop_index_t iPop=0; iPop < DESCRIPTOR::q; ++iPop) {
    for (std::size_t iCell=0; iCell < _cuboid.volume; ++iCell) {
      std::size_t jCell = descriptor::neighbor<DESCRIPTOR>(_cuboid, iCell, iPop);
      if (get(iCell) == bulk && get(jCell) == solid) {
        count++;
      }
    }
  }
  return count;
}

template <typename F>
void for_links(int bulk, int solid, F f) {
  for (pop_index_t iPop=0; iPop < DESCRIPTOR::q; ++iPop) {
    for (std::size_t iCell=0; iCell < _cuboid.volume; ++iCell) {
      std::size_t jCell = descriptor::neighbor<DESCRIPTOR>(_cuboid, iCell, iPop);
      if (get(iCell) == bulk && get(jCell) == solid) {
        f(iCell, iPop);
      }
    }
  }
}
#+END_SRC

* Visualization
** Color Palettes
Developing and selecting color plattes is a quite involved topic and a good color palette is essential for visually pleasing results.
Furthermore careful choice of colors can expose details in the fluid structure that are otherwise easy to overlook, e.g. an outlier palette
allows the visualization to focus on the variations in the upper end of the sampled values.

The colormaps are provided as ParaView-compatible XML files. For simplicity we want to render the palettes described in those files into
images that we can then sample as textures at runtime. i.e. we precompute the colors instead of interpolating them at runtime.

** Rheoscopic fluid
Rheoscopic fluids are a tool for experimental visualization of fluid flow based on small suspended particles that
tend to align themselves along the local velocity vector and shear layer. If one shines light on such a suspension
the reflected light offers a detailed view of the shear layer and velocity structure.
In this section we want to try to reproduce such a view by shading the sample values according to the local shear
layer normal vector.

*** Calculate shear layer normal
Translating the approach of Barth and Burns cite:barthVirtualRheoscopicFluids2007 into LBM
we can compute the shear layer normal from the strain rate tensor that in turn can be recovered from a
cells non-equilibrium population.

One possible use case for these shear layer normals is to extract those layers aligned with some vector.
The resulting visibility value can either be used to threshold rendering of some other value such as the
velocity norm or as a sample value by iself -- when combined with some additional coloring logic the
latter results in something that looks like a rheoscopic fluid.

** Volumetric Rendering
*** Intersection Primitives
In order to quickly check whether a given ray intersects our embedded simulation domain we implement a common
function for checking intersections with /axis-aligned bounding boxes/. Requiring the box to be axis-aligned greatly
simplifies and speeds up the problem.

  float3 t1s = (max - origin) * invD;
  float3 tsmaller = fminf(t0s, t1s);

  return (tmin < tmax);

*** Image Synthesis
Let $C$ be the color along a ray $r$ with length $L$ and given an absorption $\mu$. Then the volume rendering equation
to determine said color $C$ looks as follows:

$$C(r) = \int_0^L c(x) \mu(x) \exp\left(-\int_0^x \mu(t) dt\right) dx$$

i.e. we integrate over the color values $c(x)$ along the ray weighted by the current absorption $\mu$ and the accumulated
absorption up to the current point. This way samples that are closer to the view origin will be more prominent than samples
of the same magnitude that are farther away which of course is also a basic version of how a real volume looks, hence
the name.

We are now going to implement an optimized version of this volume rendering equation to determine
the color of a pixel in location =screen_pos= given a normalized ray direction =ray_dir= and an eye position
=camera_position= as the starting point.

This listing sets up the ray marching loop for any ray that intersects the simulation domain bounding box. It also handles
the incorporation of obstacle geometries as described by a signed distance function. We should use the exact same function
for this that we also use to set boundary material numbers or to configure interpolated bounce back distances.

The most relevant part of this is the content of the marching loop that traverses the domain and sums up the samples
along the way. We use a straight forward performance-friendfly simplification of the volume rendering equation for that.

$$C(r) = \sum_{i=0}^N C(i \Delta x) \alpha (i \Delta x) \prod_{j=0}^{i-1} \left(1 - \alpha(j\Delta x)\right)$$

*** Surface Shading
Basic shading of the SDF-described obstacles requires us to calculate surface normals for arbitrary interesection points.

Local normals are easily reconstructed from a signed distance function by sampling their neighborhood. We do not even
have to use the true distance in some direction for this as near some surface the shortest distance should be reasonably
close - at least close enough to produce correct looking visualizations.

  ));
}
#+END_SRC

*** Noise
Volumetric renderings that are produced when using a plain ray marching algorithm may
contain undesired artifacts that distract from the actual visualization. Specifically the choice
of start offsets w.r.t. to the view origin can lead to slicing artifacts. While this tends to become
less noticable for smaller step widths these are not desirable from a performance perspective.

Our renderer employs view-aligned slicing and random jittering to remove visible slicing.
The choice of /randomness/ for jittering the ray origin is critical here as plain random numbers
produce a ugly static-like pattern. A common choice in practice is to use so called /blue noise/
instead.

For performance it makes sense to precompute such blue noise into tileable textures 
than can then be easily used to fetch per-pixel-ray jitter offsets.

*** Camera Controller
A convenient way of interactively controlling the view parameters of a pinhole camera is to implement
a orbiting camera. This type of camera can be rotated around a central target point using the mouse.

While translation is realized easily by adding a shift vector to the current camera position, rotation
is more complex. We are going to accumulate all rotation operations in a single quaternion variable
=_rotation=. This 4D vector is easily converted into a rotation matrix for mapping the screen space
pinhole parameters into world space.

#+NAME: camera-spherical-coordinates
#+BEGIN_SRC cpp
glm::quat _rotation;
glm::mat3 _matrix;

Using the rotation matrix we can compute the pinhole camera parameters. As they only change
when a rotation is performed we store them in a set of variables.

float3 _position;
float3 _forward;
float3 _right;
float3 _up;
float _distance;
#+END_SRC

The =update= function projects the screen space forward, right and up vectors into world space
by simply multiplying them by the rotation matrix. 

#+NAME: camera-projection
#+BEGIN_SRC cpp :eval no :main no
glm::vec3 position = _matrix * glm::vec3(0, _distance, 0);
_position = _target + make_float3(position[0], position[1], position[2]);

glm::vec3 right = _matrix * glm::vec4(-1, 0, 0, 0);
_right = make_float3(right[0], right[1], right[2]);
glm::vec3 up = _matrix * glm::vec4(glm::cross(glm::vec3(0, 1, 0), glm::vec3(-1, 0, 0)), 0);
_up = make_float3(up[0], up[1], up[2]);

Any =Sampler= implementations we want to provide in a given simulation are maintained in a central
=_sampler= vector. The currently selected sampling method is designated by a pointer through
which the relevant =Sampler::sample=, =Sampler::interact=  and =Sampler::render= methods are
going to be called.

The =run= method controls a separate thread for updating the simulation state separately from any
visualization. This way we can e.g. vary the simulation speed or evaluate different visualization
setups for a paused state.

** Window
While we did not need to directly use e.g. OpenGL instructions to produce and display visualizations,
we still need some way of interfacing with the system UI and to display the textures generated from
CUDA. For convenience this is done using the SFML library.

As all 2D and 3D example simulations render their visualizations to 2D textures and provide
any interactivity via the Dear ImGui library a =RenderWindow= wrapper class is used to collect the
common scaffolding.

The essential component of this class is the =draw= method to which we can pass
two functions for rendering to the window texture on one hand and for providing
any UI functionality on the other hand.

      _window.setView(view);
    }
    if (!ImGui::GetIO().WantCaptureMouse) {
      mouse(event);

This functionality is sufficient for the 2D examples but as volumetric rendering both requires significantly more
scaffolding and builds on different /sampler/ classes section [[sec:volumetric-scaffold]] builds a =VolumetricExample=

** Lid-driven Cavity
The lid-driven cavity is a very common example in the LBM community due to its simple setup while
providing quite complex dynamics and extensive reference results in literature. Its geometry consists
of a plain square box with solid walls and a lid moving at a constant velocity. This lid movement then
induces a characteristic vortex structure inside the box.

After including the relevant headers and declaring which floating point precision and descriptor
type to use we are ready to set up the lattice of a \(500 \times 500\) grid.

  } else if (p.y == cuboid.nY-1) {
    return 3; // lid cell
  } else {
    return 1; // bulk

});

auto bulk_mask = materials.mask_of_material(1);
auto wall_mask = materials.mask_of_material(2);
auto lid_mask  = materials.mask_of_material(3);

cudaDeviceSynchronize();
#+END_SRC

The bulk collisions are going to use a relaxation time of \(0.51\) and the lid enacts a velocity of \(0.05\) lattice units.
This maximum velocity can be used to scale the velocity norm for visualization.

#+BEGIN_SRC cpp :tangle tangle/ldc-2d.cu

The same example can also be built in 3D and visualized using volumetric rendering.

#+BEGIN_SRC cpp :tangle tangle/ldc-3d.cu
<<example-headers>>

#include "util/volumetric_example.h"
#include "sampler/velocity_norm.h"

using T = float;
using DESCRIPTOR = descriptor::D3Q19;

int main() {
cudaSetDevice(0);
#+END_SRC

After including the relevant headers we construct the D3Q19 lattice.

#+BEGIN_SRC cpp :tangle tangle/ldc-3d.cu
const descriptor::Cuboid<DESCRIPTOR> cuboid(100, 100, 100);
Lattice<DESCRIPTOR,T> lattice(cuboid);
#+END_SRC

Before constructing the sphere we set up a basic square pipe with
separate walls, in- and outlets.

#+BEGIN_SRC cpp :tangle tangle/ldc-3d.cu
CellMaterials<DESCRIPTOR> materials(cuboid, [&cuboid](uint3 p) -> int {
  if (p.x == 0 || p.x == cuboid.nX-1 || p.y == 0 || p.y == cuboid.nY-1 || p.z == cuboid.nZ-1) {
    return 2; // boundary cell
  } else if (p.z == 0) {
    return 3; // lid cell
  } else {
    return 1; // bulk
  }
});
#+END_SRC

At this point we are ready to generate masks for operator application and to
initialize all cells with their equilibrium.

#+BEGIN_SRC cpp :tangle tangle/ldc-3d.cu
auto bulk_mask = materials.mask_of_material(1);
auto wall_mask = materials.mask_of_material(2);
auto lid_mask  = materials.mask_of_material(3);

lattice.apply(Operator(InitializeO(), bulk_mask),
              Operator(InitializeO(), wall_mask),
              Operator(InitializeO(), lid_mask));

cudaDeviceSynchronize();
#+END_SRC

In order to model the flow we employ standard BGK collisions in the bulk. The side and bottom
walls are modelled using bounce back while the lid uses moving wall bounce back.

#+NAME: ldc-3d-simulation-step

const float tau = 0.56;
const float lid = 0.10;

lattice.apply(Operator(BgkCollideO(), bulk_mask, tau),

Finally the volumetric renderer is used to control the simulation
loop and to provide velocity, curl and shear layer visualizations.

#+BEGIN_SRC cpp :tangle tangle/ldc-3d.cu
auto none = [] __device__ (float3) -> float { return 1; };

Adding another non-spinning cylinder allows for direct comparison and also produces a Kármán vortex street.

#+BEGIN_SRC cpp :tangle tangle/magnus.cu
const descriptor::Cuboid<DESCRIPTOR> cuboid(1200, 500);
Lattice<DESCRIPTOR,T> lattice(cuboid);
#+END_SRC

After setting up the lattice we define the relaxation time for the BGK collisions in the
bulk and the desired rotation and inflow velocities.

#+BEGIN_SRC cpp :tangle tangle/magnus.cu
const float tau = 0.54;
const float u_inflow = 0.02;
const float u_rotate = 0.08;
#+END_SRC

For the geometry we first distinguish between the bulk and walls ignoring the cylinders.

#+BEGIN_SRC cpp :tangle tangle/magnus.cu
CellMaterials<DESCRIPTOR> materials(cuboid, [&cuboid](uint2 p) -> int {
  if (p.x == 0) {
    return 3; // inflow
  } else if (p.x == cuboid.nX-1) {
    return 4; // outflow
  } else if (p.y == 0 || p.y == cuboid.nY-1) {
    return 2; // wall
  } else {
    return 1; // bulk
  }
});
#+END_SRC

Using free-slip conditions at the lower and upper walls requires special handling of the edge cells to prevent
artifacts from forming.

#+BEGIN_SRC cpp :tangle tangle/magnus.cu
materials.set(gid(cuboid, 0,0), 2);
materials.set(gid(cuboid, 0,cuboid.nY-1), 2);
materials.set(gid(cuboid, cuboid.nX-1,0), 5);
materials.set(gid(cuboid, cuboid.nX-1,cuboid.nY-1), 5);
#+END_SRC

Both cylinders are modelled using interpolated bounce back.

#+BEGIN_SRC cpp :tangle tangle/magnus.cu
auto cylinder = [cuboid] __host__ __device__ (float2 p) -> float {
                  float2 q = p - make_float2(cuboid.nX/6, 3*cuboid.nY/4);
                  float2 r = p - make_float2(cuboid.nX/6, 1*cuboid.nY/4);
                  return sdf::add(sdf::sphere(q, cuboid.nY/18),

                };

materials.sdf(cylinder, 0);
SignedDistanceBoundary bouzidi(lattice, materials, cylinder, 1, 0);
#+END_SRC

The distance from the rotating cylinder's center is used to decide where to set up the
moving wall boundary.

    return u_rotate * normalize(make_float2(-q.y, q.x));
  } else {
    return make_float2(0);
  }
});
#+END_SRC

The geometry setup is concluded by generating per-material masks to be used by the collision kernel.

#+BEGIN_SRC cpp :tangle tangle/magnus.cu
auto bulk_mask = materials.mask_of_material(1);
auto wall_mask = materials.mask_of_material(2);
auto inflow_mask  = materials.mask_of_material(3);
auto outflow_mask = materials.mask_of_material(4);
auto edge_mask = materials.mask_of_material(5);
#+END_SRC

The last step prior to starting the simulation loop is to initialize
all cells with their equilibrium values.

#+BEGIN_SRC cpp :tangle tangle/magnus.cu
lattice.apply(Operator(InitializeO(), bulk_mask),
              Operator(InitializeO(), wall_mask),
              Operator(InitializeO(), inflow_mask),
              Operator(InitializeO(), outflow_mask),
              Operator(InitializeO(), edge_mask));
cudaDeviceSynchronize();
#+END_SRC

During each timestep we apply all purely local collision operators in a single fused
sweep of the lattice. This is followed by calling =BouzidiO= on the SDF-generated
boundary configuration.

** Flow around a Sphere
This example models a channel flow around a spherical obstacle.

#+BEGIN_SRC cpp :tangle tangle/channel-with-sphere.cu
<<example-headers>>

#include "util/volumetric_example.h"
#include "sampler/velocity_norm.h"
#include "sampler/curl_norm.h"
#include "sampler/q_criterion.h"

using T = float;
using DESCRIPTOR = descriptor::D3Q19;

int main() {
cudaSetDevice(0);
#+END_SRC

After including the relevant headers we construct the D3Q19 lattice.

#+BEGIN_SRC cpp :tangle tangle/channel-with-sphere.cu
const descriptor::Cuboid<DESCRIPTOR> cuboid(448, 64, 64);
Lattice<DESCRIPTOR,T> lattice(cuboid);
#+END_SRC

Before constructing the sphere we set up a basic square channel with
free slip walls and separate in- and outlets.

#+BEGIN_SRC cpp :tangle tangle/channel-with-sphere.cu
CellMaterials<DESCRIPTOR> materials(cuboid, [&cuboid](uint3 p) -> int {
  if (p.z == 0 || p.z == cuboid.nZ-1) {
    return 2; // boundary cell
  } else if (p.y == 0 || p.y == cuboid.nY-1) {
    return 3; // boundary cell
  } else if (p.x == 0) {
    return 4; // inflow cell
  } else if (p.x == cuboid.nX-1) {
    return 5; // outflow cell
  } else {
    return 1; // bulk
  }
});
#+END_SRC

As the free slip bounce back condition is not well defined at the edges we use
plain bounce back instead.

#+BEGIN_SRC cpp :tangle tangle/channel-with-sphere.cu
for (std::size_t iX=0; iX < cuboid.nX; ++iX) {
  materials.set(gid(cuboid, iX, 0,           0), 6);
  materials.set(gid(cuboid, iX, cuboid.nY-1, 0), 6);
  materials.set(gid(cuboid, iX, 0,           cuboid.nZ-1), 6);
  materials.set(gid(cuboid, iX, cuboid.nY-1, cuboid.nZ-1), 6);
}
#+END_SRC

The sphere is modelled using a signed distance function from which we
generate a configuraton of the interpolated bounce back condition.

#+BEGIN_SRC cpp :tangle tangle/channel-with-sphere.cu
auto obstacle = [cuboid] __host__ __device__ (float3 p) -> float {
                  float3 q = p - make_float3(cuboid.nX/6, cuboid.nY/2, cuboid.nZ/2);
                  return sdf::sphere(q, cuboid.nY/T{5});
                };
materials.sdf(obstacle, 0);
SignedDistanceBoundary bouzidi(lattice, materials, obstacle, 1, 0);
#+END_SRC

At this point themasks for operator application can be generated followed by
initializing the lattice data.

#+BEGIN_SRC cpp :tangle tangle/channel-with-sphere.cu
auto bulk_mask    = materials.mask_of_material(1);
auto wall_mask_z  = materials.mask_of_material(2);

auto outflow_mask = materials.mask_of_material(5);
auto edge_mask    = materials.mask_of_material(6);

lattice.apply(Operator(InitializeO(), bulk_mask),
              Operator(InitializeO(), wall_mask_z),
              Operator(InitializeO(), wall_mask_y),
              Operator(InitializeO(), inflow_mask),
              Operator(InitializeO(), outflow_mask),
              Operator(InitializeO(), edge_mask));

cudaDeviceSynchronize();
#+END_SRC

In order to model the flow we employ standard BGK collisions in the bulk. The channel
walls are modelled using (free slip) bounce back and the SDF-described sphere is
represented with interpolated bounce back.

#+NAME: channel-with-sphere-simulation-step
#+BEGIN_SRC cpp :eval no
const float tau = 0.51;
const float inflow = 0.05;

lattice.apply(Operator(BgkCollideO(), bulk_mask, tau),

              Operator(BounceBackFreeSlipO(), wall_mask_y, WallNormal<0,1,0>()),
              Operator(EquilibriumVelocityWallO(), inflow_mask, std::min(iStep*1e-4, 1.0)*inflow, WallNormal<1,0,0>()),

              Operator(BounceBackO(), edge_mask));
lattice.apply<BouzidiO>(bouzidi.getCount(), bouzidi.getConfig());

lattice.stream();
#+END_SRC

Finally the volumetric renderer is used to control the simulation
loop and to provide velocity, curl and Q criterion visualizations.

#+BEGIN_SRC cpp :tangle tangle/channel-with-sphere.cu

** Taylor-Couette
A fluid confined in the gap between two rotating cylinders with sufficient angular velocity develops
interesting toroidial vortices. For this example we are going to use a special shear-layer thresholding
approach for highlighting those vortices.

#+BEGIN_SRC cpp :tangle tangle/taylor-couette.cu
<<example-headers>>

#include "util/volumetric_example.h"

using T = float;
using DESCRIPTOR = descriptor::D3Q19;

int main() {
cudaSetDevice(0);
#+END_SRC

After including the relevant headers we construct the D3Q19 lattice.

#+BEGIN_SRC cpp :tangle tangle/taylor-couette.cu
const descriptor::Cuboid<DESCRIPTOR> cuboid(320, 96, 96);
Lattice<DESCRIPTOR,T> lattice(cuboid);
#+END_SRC

The initial geometry consists only of a cube with separated left and right boundaries.

  if (p.x == 0 || p.x == cuboid.nX-1) {
    return 2;
  } else {
    return 1;
  }
});
#+END_SRC

The two cylinders are modelled using a signed distance function from which
we generate a configuraton of the interpolated bounce back condition.

#+BEGIN_SRC cpp :tangle tangle/taylor-couette.cu
auto inner_cylinder = [cuboid] __host__ __device__ (float3 p) -> float {
                        float3 q = p - make_float3(0, cuboid.nY/2, cuboid.nZ/2);
                        return sdf::sphere(make_float2(q.y,q.z), cuboid.nY/T{4.5});
                      };

                  float3 q = p - make_float3(0, cuboid.nY/2, cuboid.nZ/2);
                  return sdf::add(-sdf::sphere(make_float2(q.y,q.z), cuboid.nY/T{2.14}), inner_cylinder(p));
                };
materials.sdf(geometry, 0);
SignedDistanceBoundary bouzidi(lattice, materials, geometry, 1, 0);
#+END_SRC

The rotation of the inner cyclinder is modelled using a velocity field from which we
generate a velocity correction for the Bouzidi boundaries.

#+BEGIN_SRC cpp :tangle tangle/taylor-couette.cu
const float wall = 0.2;

bouzidi.setVelocity([cuboid,wall](float3 p) -> float3 {
  float3 q = p - make_float3(0, cuboid.nY/2, cuboid.nZ/2);
  if (length(make_float2(q.y,q.z)) < cuboid.nY/T{2.5}) {
    return wall * normalize(make_float3(0, -q.z, q.y));
  } else {
    return make_float3(0);
  }
});
#+END_SRC

At this point we are ready to generate masks for operator application and to
initialize all cells with their equilibrium.

#+BEGIN_SRC cpp :tangle tangle/taylor-couette.cu

lattice.apply<InitializeO>(bulk_list);
lattice.apply<InitializeO>(wall_list);

cudaDeviceSynchronize();
#+END_SRC

Due to the large quantity of inactive cells in this example we call the collision
operators on lists of cells instead of masking a full sweep of the lattice.

#+NAME: taylor-couette-simulation-step

** Nozzle
This is the example that was used to provide the teaser video at the start of this
document. It simulates the turbulent flow that develops when a channel flow

The notion of performance is directly tied to measuring timespans which is why
we start out by defining some helpers to store the current time and compute
how many seconds have passed between now and such a stored value.

The total performance of LBM codes is commonly measured using how many
million lattice cells are updated per second, denoted as MLUPs for short.
